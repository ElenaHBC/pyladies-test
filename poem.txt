PyLadies

PyLadies do not bake pies
Or maybe they do, beneath digital skies
Where code weaves tales in strings of light,
In Python's realm, their skills take flight.

With eager minds and screens aglow,
They learn to craft, to code, to grow.
In bytes and bits, they find their voice,
PyLadies shaping a digital choice.

In this realm where logic reigns supreme,
They build their dreams, a vibrant theme.
No gender bias, no limits set,
In Python's world, they boldly bet.

So let them code, let them thrive,
PyLadies shaping the tech alive.
In ones and zeros, they find their place,
A testament to talent, skill, and grace.
